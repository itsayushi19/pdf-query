# pdf-query
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation model that can process and understand content from a set of supplied PDF documents using Langchain and AstraDB

# Libraries used - 
## cassio - 
Cassio is employed for interacting with the database. It provides functionalities to store
and retrieve vectors efficiently.
## langchain - 
Langchain is a framework that offers tools for working with natural language data.
It provides modules for vectorization, indexing, and language model interactions
## open ai - 
The OpenAI API is integrated to access language model capabilities and generate
embeddings for text
## tiktoken - 
Tiktoken is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use when it comes to tokenizing
text and managing tokenized data.
## PyPDF2 - 
This library is utilized for parsing PDF documents and extracting text content.
# Retreival Augmented Geberation (RAG) Architecture - 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, represents a cutting-edge approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). At its core, RAG is an innovative framework that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models, revolutionizing how AI systems understand and generate human-like text. The development of RAG is a direct response to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT. While LLMs have shown impressive text generation capabilities, they often struggle to provide contextually relevant responses, hindering their utility in practical applications. RAG aims to bridge this gap by offering a solution that excels in understanding user intent and delivering meaningful and context-aware replies.
